Deploying SPOCs in a University Institution with Open edX: What Do We Need?,Francisco Cruz Argudo,"The presentation try to describe the experience of creating and exploiting of SPOCs at UC3M for use to supplement classroom training (flipping classroom) using the Open edX platform. In the presentation we will try  various aspects like customizing the platform to adapt to our environment (for example LDAP support) and additional software tools which we have had to be developed to facilitate the whole process management and content creation, which takes associated with the creation of a MOOCs / SPOCs.

Building Successful Open edX Instructors from Non-Faculty Domain Experts,"Julie Mullen, Lauren Edwards, and Vijay Gadepally","Traditionally, the knowledge held by professional engineers, scientists and researchers has only been accessible to a small number of co-workers.  The open edX platform enables MIT Lincoln Laboratory to share the knowledge of world-class domain experts through technical education courses highlighting theory and its use in practice.  Building successful online courses requires that technical professionals, with limited teaching experience, develop a teaching mindset.  In this presentation we discuss the approaches used to help non-faculty instructors gain an awareness of the open edX andragogy and the path followed to transition from presenter to educational guide."
Navigating Barriers to Implementation of an International Medical Training Course in Developing Nations,Nicholus Warstadt,"Clubfoot is a congenital birth deformity easily and effectively treatable by the low-resource requiring and non-surgical Ponseti method, but knowledge of this technique has yet to disseminate to rural hospitals and clinics in developing countries. Current training practices are dominated by non-profit organizations investing extensive time, resources, and man-power to host centralized, annual trainings. Here, we describe our experience in working with these same non-profit organizations to develop and implement a standardized digital training through the Open edX platform, including barriers of technology, multi-instance administration, and the need for content customization.
