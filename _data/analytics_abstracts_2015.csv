Digging through the data - MoocCzar,"Andrew Dekker and John Zornig","This talk discusses the research data package that edX provides to partners, and how this data can be explored to learn more about the students taking our courses.  To assist in this, we have developed a platform - MoocCzar, an open source project which helps edX teams uncover and disseminate data gathered from edX courses.  The talk discusses the development and future of MoocCzar, and how this learning data can help influence future course design and development."
