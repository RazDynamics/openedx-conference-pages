"OpenStack for edX: Inside, and Out",Adolfo Brandes and Florian Haas,"You're planning a highly-available LMS deployment for thousands of students. Your courses teach various facets of distributed computing, so you want each and every one of your students to have a fully scaled-out, distributed environment to play with (and break!).  As icing on the cake, you want to deploy on OpenStack, the hottest cloud tech on the market.  How do you build all this so that courses don't cost a fortune? We took a stab at it, and here we'll share how we: 1) run edX itself on OpenStack, and 2) leverage the flexibility of both edX and OpenStack to fire up (and bring down!) lab environments on demand, and present them seamlessly to the student."
Pragmatic development lessons from UQx,"Andrew Dekker and John Zornig","This talk reflects on the development that the UQx team has conducted over the last 18 months, and discusses the various tools we have developed to help UQx students to achieve their learning objectives.  The talk will also discuss the practical limitations of working with online platforms (in particular edX), and how we leverage the platform to create the best experience possible.  We will detail how we decide which technologies and processes to use when developing a solution, and present recommendations on how to develop new tools within the platform."
Configuration Primer,Feanil Patel,"Open edX uses ansible for configuration management.  This talk would give people an overview of the configuration repo, introducing the layout and organization of our ansible roles with some examples of how to use them."
Building the Plane While Flying it - Migrating an Existing MOOC to edX,"Mike Bifulco, Andrew Miller, Jeremy Osborn, and Michael Bingham-Hawk","Over the past year, Aquent's MOOC for designers, <a href=""http://www.thegymnasium.com/"">The Gymnasium</a>, has been going through the process of migrating to Open EdX from a third-party SaaS platform. During this talk, we'll discuss what our move was like - including requirements gathering, theming and customization of the edx platform, migration of the many thousands of existing student records, creation of courses on EdX, and setting up a production deployment environment and life cycle with a hosting partner."
Life in the Avant-Garde,Regis Behmo,"As developers of a platform based on Open edX, we tend to follow pretty closely the master branch of the edx-platform repository. On the other hand, our infrastructure differs greatly from edX, in particular for storage. How do we manage to keep up with upstream development while maintaining our sanity? In this talk, we will describe our internal deployment processes, the tricks we found to overcome some issues, and will give advice to the edX developers to keep fostering a great open source community."
Contributing to Open edX,Xavier Antoviaque and Sarina Canelake,"You want to contribute to edX? This talk will walk you through the Open edX contribution process, step by step, using a sample contribution as an example."
