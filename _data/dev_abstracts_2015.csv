openstack,"OpenStack for edX: Inside, and Out",Adolfo Brandes and Florian Haas,"You're planning a highly-available LMS deployment for thousands of students. Your courses teach various facets of distributed computing, so you want each and every one of your students to have a fully scaled-out, distributed environment to play with (and break!).  As icing on the cake, you want to deploy on OpenStack, the hottest cloud tech on the market.  How do you build all this so that courses don't cost a fortune? We took a stab at it, and here we'll share how we: 1) run edX itself on OpenStack, and 2) leverage the flexibility of both edX and OpenStack to fire up (and bring down!) lab environments on demand, and present them seamlessly to the student."
dev-at-uqx,Pragmatic development lessons from UQx,"Andrew Dekker and John Zornig","This talk reflects on the development that the UQx team has conducted over the last 18 months, and discusses the various tools we have developed to help UQx students to achieve their learning objectives.  The talk will also discuss the practical limitations of working with online platforms (in particular edX), and how we leverage the platform to create the best experience possible.  We will detail how we decide which technologies and processes to use when developing a solution, and present recommendations on how to develop new tools within the platform."
avant-garde,Life in the Avant-Garde,Regis Behmo,"As developers of a platform based on Open edX, we tend to follow pretty closely the master branch of the edx-platform repository. On the other hand, our infrastructure differs greatly from edX, in particular for storage. How do we manage to keep up with upstream development while maintaining our sanity? In this talk, we will describe our internal deployment processes, the tricks we found to overcome some issues, and will give advice to the edX developers to keep fostering a great open source community."
migrating-mooc,Building the Plane While Flying it - Migrating an Existing MOOC to edX,"Mike Bifulco, Andrew Miller, Jeremy Osborn, and Michael Bingham-Hawk","Over the past year, Aquent's MOOC for designers, <a href=""http://www.thegymnasium.com/"">The Gymnasium</a>, has been going through the process of migrating to Open EdX from a third-party SaaS platform. During this talk, we'll discuss what our move was like - including requirements gathering, theming and customization of the edx platform, migration of the many thousands of existing student records, creation of courses on EdX, and setting up a production deployment environment and life cycle with a hosting partner."
config-primer,Configuration Primer,Feanil Patel,"Open edX uses ansible for configuration management.  This talk would give people an overview of the configuration repo, introducing the layout and organization of our ansible roles with some examples of how to use them."
contributing-to-openedx,Contributing to Open edX,Xavier Antoviaque and Sarina Canelake,"You want to contribute to edX? This talk will walk you through the Open edX contribution process, step by step, using a sample contribution as an example."
lti-and-sso,Integrating Open edX with Campus Systems,"Beth Porter, Braden MacDonald, and Phil MacGachey","Learn about two major advances in the Open edX platform that support interoperability with campus systems, namely, institutional identity providers and learning management systems. Using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and Shibboleth, we now allow learners to authenticate into Open edX using their school credentials. Using LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability), we also allow instructors to smoothly integrate Open edX instructional content into Canvas and Blackboard courses. Using these open educational standards, we join a large community of service providers who enable learners to use online resources to deeply enrich their campus-based experiences. In this talk, we will discuss the capabilities entailed in each of these platform areas, as well as the process used to design, validate, and implement the features."
dev-for-accessibility,Developing for accessibility,Mark Sadeki,"edX is committed to making the Open edX platform a fully accessible platform in alignment with our goals, values, vision and mission, to enable our partners and the community to create quality educational experiences for everyone. Mark Sadecki, the edX Accessibility Coordinator, will talk about efforts underway to make the platform WCAG 2.0 AA compliant (and what that even means), and well as addressing specific, common accessibility challenges that Open edX contributors may encounter."
france-hackathon,"Organizing the Largest Open edX Hackathon Yet + the Winner: Embedding XBlock Exercises in Video","Laurent David, Philippe Chiu, Elie Mietkiewicz, Arnaud Wijns, Hajar Mouradi","Find out the lessons learned during #openedxhack, the 1st Open edX Hackathon in France, and also the largest Open edX Hackathon yet with 180 participants.  We aim to encourage people to organize more Open edX Hackathon by sharing best practices. The French Open edX Hackathon winning team will also present their project: embedded quizzes in video using XBlocks."
