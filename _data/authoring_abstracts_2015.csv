MIT Learning Object Repository for Education,Peter Wilkins,"We will discuss our new project for managing courseware content across courses, disciplines and runs via our LORE project (<a href=""https://github.com/mitodl/lore"">https://github.com/mitodl/lore</a>).  LORE allows you to import Open edX courses and be paired with meta data from analytics such as the average grade, or number of attempts.  From there you can use it to find, categorize, and mix and match problems or whole sections of different courses to share and re-use existing content in new ways."
Semantic Tagging Using Asides in Studio,Cole Shaw and Ross Strader,"In this talk, we will discuss one of the first implementations of XBlock Asides, which we use to semantically tag problems in edX courses. Both MIT and the Open Learning Initiative at Stanford will present on their respective use cases and show how Asides can enhance the student and instructor experiences."
Open edX and Adaptive Learning,Glyn Polson,This discussion would focus on the need for different assessment functionalities with a focus on adaptive learning. This talk will provide examples of how adaptive learning works within the Open edX platform.
