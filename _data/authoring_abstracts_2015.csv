mit-lore,MIT Learning Object Repository for Education,Peter Wilkins,"We will discuss our new project for managing courseware content across courses, disciplines and runs via our LORE project (<a href=""https://github.com/mitodl/lore"">https://github.com/mitodl/lore</a>).  LORE allows you to import Open edX courses and be paired with meta data from analytics such as the average grade, or number of attempts.  From there you can use it to find, categorize, and mix and match problems or whole sections of different courses to share and re-use existing content in new ways."
semantic-tagging,Semantic Tagging Using Asides in Studio,Cole Shaw and Ross Strader,"In this talk, we will discuss one of the first implementations of XBlock Asides, which we use to semantically tag problems in edX courses. Both MIT and the Open Learning Initiative at Stanford will present on their respective use cases and show how Asides can enhance the student and instructor experiences."
adaptive-learning,Open edX and Adaptive Learning,Ed Daciuk,"Adaptive learning. You've heard the hype; now learn how to deliver on its promise and potential. Focussing on the intersection of Open edX and adaptive learning technology, this discussion will delve into recent developments that allows the Open edX platform to provide adaptive learning pathways to users. We will discuss the emerging landscape of adaptive technology, illustrate the use cases for integrating adaptive learning into the Open edX platform, and show how a major international corporation is integrating third party solutions with Open edX to develop cutting edge, scalable courses with personalized learning pathways for traditionally static areas like corporate training and regulatory compliance."
